The enclave's code (and any initial data) isn't encrypted until the
pages are loaded into the Enclave Page Cache (EPC), which can only
be done by the kernel (via ENCLS[EADD]).  In other words, both the
kernel and userspace can vet the code/data before running an enclave.

Practically speaking, an enclave will be coupled with an untrusted
userspace runtime, i.e. it's loader.  Enclaves are also measured
as part of their build process, and so the enclave loader needs to
know which pages to add to the measurement, and in what order.  I
guess technically speaking an enclave could have zero pages added
to its measurement, but that'd probably be a big red flag that said
enclave is up to something fishy.
