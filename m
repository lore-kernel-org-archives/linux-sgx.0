Ah, so instead of the enclave rudely "hijacking" the EENTER context, we
have it nicely return and nicely _hint_ to the calling context what it
would like to do.  Then, the EENTER context can make a controlled
transition over to the requested context.

As long as the memory pointed to by host_state.sp is valid and can hold
the signal frame (grows down without clobbering anything), what goes
boom?  The signal handling would push a signal frame and call the
handler.  It would have a shallow-looking stack, but the handler could
just do its normal business and return from the signal where the frame
would get popped and continue with %rsp=host_state.sp, blissfully
unaware of the signal ever having happened.
