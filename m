My general feeling is that userspace should be allowed to do apparently stu=
pid things. For example, as far as the kernel is concerned, Wine and DOSEMU=
 are just user programs that do stupid things. Linux generally tries to pro=
vide a reasonably complete view of architectural behavior. This is in contr=
ast to, say, Windows, where IIUC doing an unapproved WRFSBASE May cause ver=
y odd behavior indeed. So magic fixups that do non-architectural things are=
 not so great.

The flip side, of course, is that the architecture is arguably inherently e=
rratic here, and it=E2=80=99s apparently impossible to have an SGX library =
with sane semantics without some kernel assistance.

So if we can make my straw man API work, perhaps with vDSO or rseq-like hel=
p, then the official SDK can use it, but less well behaved programs can sti=
ll mostly work.  (Modulo Linux=E2=80=99s non-support for EINITTOKEN, of cou=
rse.)

Thinking about it some more, the major sticking point may be finding the RI=
P and stack frame of EENTER in the AEP code or in its fixup. The vDSO can=
=E2=80=99t use TLS without serious hackery.  We could massively abuse WRFSB=
ASE, but that=E2=80=99s really ugly.

(How does the Windows case work?  If there=E2=80=99s an exception after the=
 untrusted stack allocation and before EEXIT and SEH tries to handle it, ho=
w does the unwinder figure out where to start?)
