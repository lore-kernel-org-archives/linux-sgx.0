So I guess the non-enclave code basically can=E2=80=99t trust its stack poi=
nter because of these shenanigans. And the AEP code has to live with the fa=
ct that its RSP is basically arbitrary and probably can=E2=80=99t even be u=
nwound by a debugger?  And the EENTER code has to deal with the fact that i=
ts red zone can be blatantly violated by the enclave?

I=E2=80=99m assuming it=E2=80=99s way too late for the SGX SDK to be change=
d to use a normal RPC mechanism? I=E2=80=99m a bit disappointed that enclav=
es can even manipulate outside state like this. I assume Intel had some rea=
son for making it possible, but still.=
