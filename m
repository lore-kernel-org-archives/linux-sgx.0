Hmm.  The idea being that the SDK preserves RBP but not RSP.  That's
not the most terrible thing in the world.  But could the SDK live with
something more like my suggestion where the vDSO supplies a normal
function that takes a struct containing registers that are visible to
the enclave?  This would make it extremely awkward for the enclave to
use the untrusted stack per se, but it would make it quite easy (I
think) for the untrusted part of the SDK to allocate some extra memory
and just tell the enclave that *that* memory is the stack.

AFAFICS we do have two registers that genuinely are preserved: FSBASE
and GSBASE.  Which is a good thing, because otherwise SGX enablement
would currently be a privilege escalation issue due to making GSBASE
writable when it should not be.

This whole thing is a mess.  I'm starting to think that the cleanest
solution would be to provide a way to just tell the kernel that
certain RIP values have exception fixups.
