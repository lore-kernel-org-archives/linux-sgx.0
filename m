What exactly does "uses the untrusted stack to pass parameters for
EEXIT" mean? I guess you're saying that the enclave is writing to
RSP+[0...some_positive_offset], and the written data needs to be
visible to the code outside the enclave afterwards?

In other words, the vDSO helper would have to not touch the stack
pointer (only using the 128-byte redzone to store spilled data, at
least across the enclave entry), and return by decrementing the stack
pointer by 8 immediately before returning (storing the return pointer
in the redzone)?

So you'd call the vDSO helper with a normal "call
vdso_helper_address", then the vDSO helper does "add rsp, 8", then the
vDSO helper does its magic, and then it returns with "sub rsp, 8" and
"ret"? That way you don't touch anything on the high-address side of
RSP while still avoiding running into CET problems. (I'm assuming that
you can use CET in a process that is hosting SGX enclaves?)
