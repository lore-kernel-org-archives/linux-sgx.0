If we would have a syscall to specify a list fixups that would do the
job. Now essentially the only reason we require a vDSO is to implement
a single fixup for EENTER.

If this fixup stuff makes sense for other parts of the kernel,
introducing a vDSO for EENTER means essentially adding ABI to the kernel
that might possibly become legacy fast.
