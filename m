So what exactly happens when an enclave accesses non-enclave memory
and takes a page fault, for example?  The SDM says that the #PF vector
and error code are stored in the SSA frame where the kernel can't see
them.  Is a real #PF then delivered?

I guess that, if the memory in question gets faulted in, then the
kernel resumes exection at the AEP address, which does ERESUME, and
the enclave resumes.  But if the access is bad, then the kernel
delivers a signal (or uses some other new mechanism), and then what
happens?  Is the enclave just considered dead?  Is user code supposed
to EENTER back into the enclave to tell it that it got an error?

This whole mechanism seems very complicated, and it's not clear
exactly what behavior user code wants.
